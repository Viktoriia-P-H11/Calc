Tools and Concepts Used:

    Overloaded Methods:
    I implemented method overloading in C# to handle operations with two numbers as well as multiple numbers. This allows the program to dynamically process different types of input based on user selection.

    Switch Expression:
    I used the switch expression to evaluate the operation the user wants to perform (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). This makes the code more concise and readable.

    Exception Handling:
    The program includes exception handling (try-catch) to manage potential errors such as invalid input, division by zero, or other exceptions that might occur during execution. This ensures the program remains stable and provides feedback to the user.

    String Manipulation:
    I used string manipulation techniques, like Split and Trim, to parse the user input for multiple numbers separated by commas. This makes it possible for the user to enter a list of numbers, which are then processed by the program.

    Infinite Loop (while loop):
    I implemented a while loop to allow the user to repeatedly input operations and numbers until they choose to exit the program by typing "exit". This ensures that the program keeps running for continuous use.

    LINQ (String.Join):
    I used string.Join to format the output, so the program can display the numbers with the correct operation in the result message, making the output user-friendly.

    Argument Parsing and Validation:
    The program includes input validation for both the operation and the numbers. It ensures that the user inputs the correct format for numbers and prevents invalid operations like division by zero.
